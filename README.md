# find-the-gang
Using data from GTD to find the suspect gang for specific events.

---

cal weight.py - compute the weight by the data which the criminal gang is certain.
get solution.py - compute the suspect distance for crime in prob_2.txt and list them in order. The smaller the distance is, the larger the possibility could be.
